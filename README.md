# webserver
- I created a simple web server in golang using net/http package. 
- In order to use this code you can clone or fork this repository and run the code
- after running the code you'll see a message saying running server at `port:8080`
- now you can check/search on chrome or whatever browser you like just search - `localhost:8080/form.html` and you'll see 
something like this,

- now go ahead and submit your `POST`request and it'll redirect you to the result page.
